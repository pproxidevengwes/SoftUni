Download the skeleton provided in Judge. Do not change the packages!
Pay attention to name the package parking, all the classes, their fields and methods the same way they are presented in the following document.
It is also important to keep the project structure as described.
Problem description
Your task is to create a repository, which stores items by creating the classes described below.
First, write a Java class Pet with the following fields:
•	name: String
•	age: int
•	owner: String
The class constructor should receive name, age and owner.  You need to create the appropriate getters and setters. The class should override the
toString() method in the following format:
"{name} {age} ({owner})"
Next, write a Java class Clinic that has data (a collection, which stores the Pets). All entities inside the repository have the same fields. Also, 
the Clinic class should have those filelds:
•	capacity: int
The class constructor should receive capacity, also it should initialize the data with a new instance of the collection. Implement the following features:
•	Field data – List that holds added pets
•	Method add(Pet pet) – adds an entity to the data if there is an empty cell for the pet.
•	Method remove(String name) – removes the pet by given name, if such exists, and returns boolean.
•	Method getPet(String name, String owner) – returns the pet with the given name and owner or null if no such pet exists.
•	Method getOldestPet() – returns the oldest Pet.
•	Getter getCount – returns the number of pets.
•	getStatistics() – returns a String in the following format:
o	"The clinic has the following patients:
{name} {owner}
{name} {owner} 
   (…)"
Constraints
•	The combinations of names and owners will always be unique.
•	The age of the pets will always be positive.
