Problem description
Your task is to create a repository, which stores items by creating the classes described below.
Car
First, write a Java class Car with the following public fields:
•	manufacturer: String
•	model: String

method in the following format:
"{manufacturer} {model} ({year})"

Also, the Dealership class should have those public fields:
•	name: String
•	capacity: int
The class constructor should receive name and capacity, also it should initialize the data with a new instance of the collection.
Implement the following features:
•	Field data – Collection that holds added cars
•	Method add(Car car) – adds an entity to the data if there is an empty cell for the car.
