Selling
 
You successfully started your cooking journey, so now you need to sell the products from your basket  in the bakery in order to collect your price.
You will be given an integer n for the size of the bakery with square shape. On the next n lines, you will receive the rows of the bakery. You will be placed on a random position, marked with the letter 'S'. On random positions there will be clients, marked with a single digit. There may also be pillars. Their count will be either 0 or 2 and they are marked with the letter - 'O'. All of the empty positions will be marked with '-'.
Each turn, you will be given commands for the your movement. Move commands will be: "up", "down", "left", "right". If you move to a client, you collects the price equal to the digit there and the client disappears. If you move to a pillar, you move on the position of the other pillar and then both pillars disappear. If you go out of the bakery, you disappear from the bakery and you are out of there. You need at least 50 dollars to rent your own Bakery
When you are out of the bakery or you collect enough money, the program ends.
