Parking

Parking games are also among the popular games. Let's create one.

Preparation
Download the skeleton. Do not change the packages!
Pay attention to name the package parking, all the classes, their fields and methods the same way they are presented in the following document. It is also important to keep the project structure as described.
Problem description
Your task is to create a repository, which stores items by creating the classes described below.
Car
First, write a Java class Car with the following fields:
•	manufacturer: String
•	model: String
•	year: int
The class constructor should receive manufacturer, model and year. You need to create the appropriate getters and setters. Override the toString() method in the following format:
"{manufacturer} {model} ({year})"
Parking
Next, write a Java class Parking that has data (Collection, which stores the entity Car). All entities inside the repository have the same fields. Also, the Parking class should have those fields:
•	type: String
•	capacity: int
The class constructor should receive type and capacity, also it should initialize the data with a new instance of the collection. Implement the following features:
•	Field data – Collection that holds added cars
•	Method add(Car car) – adds an entity to the data if there is an empty cell for the car.
•	Method remove(String manufacturer, String model) – removes the car by given manufacturer and model, if such exists, and returns boolean.
•	Method getLatestCar() – returns the latest car (by year) or null if have no cars.
•	Method getCar(String manufacturer, String model) – returns the car with the given manufacturer and model or null if there is no such car.
•	Getter getCount() – returns the number of cars.
•	getStatistics() – returns a String in the following format:
o	"The cars are parked in {parking type}:
{Car1}
{Car2}
(…)"
Constraints
•	The combinations of manufacturers and models will be always unique.
•	The year of the cars will always be positive.
•	There won't be cars with the same years.
