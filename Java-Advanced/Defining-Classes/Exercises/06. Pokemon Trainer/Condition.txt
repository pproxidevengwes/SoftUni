6.	Pokémon Trainer
You wanna be the very best pokemon trainer, like no one ever was, so you set out to catch pokemons. Define a class Trainer and a class Pokemon. Trainer has a name, number of badges and a collection of pokemon. Pokemon has a name, an element and health, all values are mandatory. Every Trainer starts with 0 badges.
From the console you will receive an unknown number of lines until you receive the command "Tournament", each line will carry information about a pokemon and the trainer who caught it in the format "<TrainerName> <PokemonName> <PokemonElement> <PokemonHealth>" where TrainerName is the name of the Trainer who caught the pokemon, names are unique there cannot be 2 trainers with the same name. After receiving the command "Tournament" an unknown number of lines containing one of three elements "Fire", "Water", "Electricity" will follow until the command "End" is received. For every command you must check if a trainer has at least 1 pokemon with the given element, if he does he receives 1 badge, otherwise all his pokemon lose 10 health, if a pokemon falls to 0 or less health he dies and must be deleted from the trainer’s collection. After the command "End" is received you should print all trainers sorted by the amount of badges they have in descending order (if two trainers have the same amount of badges they should be sorted by order of appearance in the input) in the format "<TrainerName> <Badges> <NumberOfPokemon".
