1.	Fill the Matrix
Filling a matrix in the regular way (top to bottom and left to right) is boring. Write two methods that fill a matrix of size N x N in two different patterns. Both patterns are described below:
Pattern A	Pattern B

Examples
Input	 3, A
Output
1 4 7 
2 5 8 
3 6 9
Input	 3, B
Output
1 6 7 
2 5 8 
3 4 9
