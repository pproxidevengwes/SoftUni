3.	Diagonal Difference
Write a program that finds the difference between the sums of the square matrix diagonals (absolute value).
 
Input
•	The first line holds a number n – the size of matrix.
•	The next n lines hold the values for every row – n numbers separated by a space.


Examples
Input		
3
11 2 4
4 5 6
10 8 -12	
Output  15	
Comments
Primary diagonal: sum = 11 + 5 + (-12) = 4
Secondary diagonal: sum = 4 + 5 + 10 = 19
Difference: |4 - 19| = 15
