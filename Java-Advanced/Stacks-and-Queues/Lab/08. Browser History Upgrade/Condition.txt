8.	Browser History Upgrade
Extend "Browser History" with a "forward" instruction which visits URLs that were navigated away from by "back"
Each forward instruction visits the next most-recent such URL. If a normal navigation happens, all potential forward URLs are removed until a new back instruction is given If the forward instruction canâ€™t be executed, print 
"no next URLs".
