4.	Basic Queue Operations
You will be given an integer N representing the number of elements to enqueue (add), an integer S representing the number of elements to dequeue (remove/poll) from the queue and finally an integer X, an element that you should check whether is present in the queue. If it is print true on the console, if itâ€™s not print the smallest element currently present in the queue.
Examples
Input		
5 2 32
1 13 45 32 4 
Output		true 
\\Comments
We have to push 5 elements. 
Then we pop 2 of them. 
Finally, we have to check whether 13 is present in the stack. Since it is we print true.

Input
4 1 666
666 69 13 420
Output	13	

Input
3 3 90
