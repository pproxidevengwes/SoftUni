Problem 2.	Extended Database
You already have a class - Database. This time it is extended. There are the following provided methods:  adding, removing and finding People. In other words, it should store People. There should be two types of finding methods - first: findById (long id) and the second one: findByUsername (String username). As you may guess, each person should have its own unique id, and unique username. Your task is to test these functions.
Constraints
Database should have methods:
•	add
o	If there are multiple users with this id, throw OperationNotSupportedException.
o	If negative nor null ids are present, throw OperationNotSupportedException. 
•	remove
•	findByUsername
o	If no user is present by this username, throw OperationNotSupportedException.
o	If username parameter is null, throw OperationNotSupportedException.
o	Arguments are all CaseSensitive!
•	findById
o	If no user is present by this id, throw OperationNotSupportedException.
Hint
Do not forget to test the constructor(s). They are methods too!
