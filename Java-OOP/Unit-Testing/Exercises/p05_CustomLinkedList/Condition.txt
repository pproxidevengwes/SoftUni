Problem 5.	Custom Linked List
You are given a data structure that needs to be tested. Use the Java file CustomLinkedList.java and:
•	Create Test Class and Test Methods for all public members that need testing.
•	Create tests that ensure all methods, getters and setters work correctly.
•	Use the @Test(expected = ExpectedException.class) annotation for methods that are expected to throw exception
in case wrong input is entered (those tests don’t need assert messages).
•	Give meaningful assert messages for failed tests.
