Problem 1.	Database
You are given a simple class - Database. It stores Integers. Your task is to test the class. Write tests, so you are sure its methods are working as intended.
Constraints
•	Storing array's capacity must be exactly 16 integers.
o	If the size of the array is not 16 integers long, throw OperationNotSupportedException. 
•	Add operation, should add an element at the next free cell. (just like a stack)
o	If passed element is null throw OperationNotSupportedException.
•	Remove operation, should support only removing an element at the last index. (just like a stack)
o	If you try to remove element from empty Database throw OperationNotSupportedException
•	Constructors should take integers only, and store them in array.
•	Fetch method should return the elements as array.
Hint
Do not forget to test the constructor(s). They are methods too!
